# Machine Learning for Business – Project Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  
This repository showcases several hands-on machine learning projects completed as part of my graduate coursework at Park University. Throughout this course, I explored real-world challenges using Python, open-source datasets, and a range of machine learning techniques—including regression, model explainability, and neural networks.

Whether you're a recruiter, student, or fellow data enthusiast, feel free to explore the folders below to see how I approach problem-solving through data.

## 📁 Project Highlights

### 🔹 Obesity and Physical Inactivity: Regression Modeling
Used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Lasso, Quantile, and Logistic Regression to evaluate the link between physical inactivity and obesity across U.S. states. Built on CDC health surveillance data, this project focuses on predictive modeling to support data-informed public health strategies.

### 🔹 Health Metrics Forecasting: SHAP & XGBoost
Explored the interpretability of machine learning models using SHAP values and Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs). Leveraged Random Forest and XGBoost to uncover which health survey inputs most influenced predicted outcomes.

### 🔹 Wine Quality Prediction: Neural Networks
Built a neural network using Scikit-learn’s MLPClassifier to classify red wine as “good” or “not good” based on its chemical attributes. Achieved ~86% test accuracy and included detailed visualizations like the confusion matrix and classification report.
