# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning for Business – Project Portfolio
Welcome! 👋 This repository features a collection of hands-on machine learning projects I completed as part of my graduate coursework at Park University. Each project gave me the chance to explore real-world data challenges—ranging from public health analytics to wine quality classification—through the lens of predictive modeling and explainable AI.

You'll find work that combines data analysis, model building, and interpretability, all powered by Python and open-source datasets. Whether you're here to get inspired, see how I apply machine learning in context, or explore SHAP values and neural networks in action—there's something here for you.

📁 Project Highlights
Obesity and Physical Inactivity Regression
I used multiple regression models—OLS, Lasso, Quantile, and Logistic—to examine how physical inactivity affects obesity rates across the U.S. This project was built on CDC health surveillance data and focused on helping public health leaders make data-informed decisions.

Health Metrics Forecasting with SHAP and XGBoost
This project dives into model explainability. Using Random Forest and XGBoost, I predicted health outcomes from survey data and applied SHAP and PDP to break down which features mattered most. It’s a powerful demonstration of how machine learning and transparency can work hand-in-hand.

Wine Quality Classification with Neural Networks
Using a multi-layer perceptron (MLPClassifier), I built a neural network to predict whether red wine samples would be considered “good” or “not good” based on their chemical properties. This one was fun, practical, and a great exercise in scaling and performance tuning.
